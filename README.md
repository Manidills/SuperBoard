- **Addresses**: 
  - **New Addresses**: Insight into the growth of new users and adoption rates.
  - **Active Addresses**: Monitoring user activity to identify engagement trends.
  - **Transfer Volume**: Analysis of asset transfers within and across Optimism, helping developers identify key usage patterns.

- **Economics**:
  - **Market Cap**: Assessment of the economic value of projects on Optimism.
  - **L2 Revenue**: Measurement of Layer 2 solution revenues to understand financial performance.
  - **Volume**: Liquidity and trading volume analytics for Optimism-based projects.
  - **Profit**: Financial viability and profitability metrics for projects built on Optimism.

- **Leaderboards**: Tracking the top-performing projects on Optimism, providing visibility into the ecosystem's leaders.

- **NFT Mints**: Comprehensive analytics on NFT minting activities within the Optimism ecosystem.

- **Contracts**: Insights into smart contract deployments and interactions on Optimism, offering a window into developer activity.

### Blockscout

The **Blockscout Python SDK** is the backbone of SuperBoard. It was meticulously developed to simplify the development process for Python developers, making it easier to build, analyze, and deploy advanced analytics dashboards. The SDK is a game-changer for the Web3 community, especially for those working within the superchain ecosystem. Key benefits include:

- **Streamlined Development**: The SDK abstracts away much of the complexity involved in interacting with superchain data, allowing developers to focus on building impactful features.
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: It provides a suite of tools that are essential for superchain analytics, from data fetching to complex visualization, making it a must-have for developers working on blockchain projects.
- **Accessibility**: By bringing Python developers into the Web3 space, the SDK makes blockchain data more accessible and understandable, empowering even those with limited blockchain experience to contribute to the ecosystem.

### EAS Protocol Analytics

The **Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)** is a rapidly growing protocol, and SuperBoard provides a powerful analytics platform that brings clarity to this complex system. We leverage the Blockscout SDK to offer deep insights into EAS, particularly for:

- **EAS Across Chains**: SuperBoard visualizes EAS activity across different chains, making it easier to identify trends and patterns.
- **Optimism-Specific Analytics**: Detailed metrics on EAS within the Optimism ecosystem, including attestations, schema names, and off-chain revocations.
- **Passport.gitcoin.co [Optimism] Analytics**: In-depth analysis of the Gitcoin Passport on Optimism, offering developers valuable insights into user behavior and engagement.
- **Network Graph Visualization**: Using advanced network graphs, SuperBoard helps developers explore connections within the EAS protocol, identifying common patterns and optimizing the protocol's performance.

### AI-Driven Insights

SuperBoard's AI-driven insights are a core feature that sets it apart from other analytics platforms. Our AI not only validates and processes data in real-time but also summarizes key findings, providing developers with actionable insights that can significantly enhance decision-making and project outcomes.
